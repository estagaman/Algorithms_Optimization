    "Some of these alignments are slightly different from the example alignments in the key, but they all have the same number of mismatches, matches, and gaps. My impression of this is that some sequences might technically have multiple optimal alignments, and my code probably checks for a gap before it checks for a mismatch because of the order of if/else statements in my find_alignment() function. I would guess this is why the alignments are slightly different, but I don't think that either is incorrect. If I wanted to be the same as the key, I would probably check for mismatch before gap in my find_alignment() statement. "
